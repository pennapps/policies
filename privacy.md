#PennApps Privacy Policy

##Overview
Our privacy policy is aimed at making our online personal data practices more transparent out of respect to the privacy of people visiting and using our websites. Specifically, it describes what information we collect, how we collect it, and who has access to it. Most of this information is common sense, however we believe firmly in giving people the right to know how their information is being used.

Our policy applies to websites PennApps owns and controls, including pennapps.com and its related subdomains. It does not apply to the personal data practices of our sponsors’ and partner organizations’ sites. Finally, the policy is subject to change at any time at the sole discretion of PennApps without notice.

##Information We Collect
All of the personal information we collect on users can be categorized into one of four areas.

###1. Personal Information of Applicants and Attendees
When you register for an account on my.pennapps.com in order to apply to attend PennApps, you willingly provide us with information as part of your application and as part of forms you submit leading up to, during, and after our event. Unless specified below, this information is not shared with anybody outside of the PennApps organizing team and is used only for application review and for purposes directly related to running our hackathon.

Starting with PennApps XII (Fall 2015), we’re collecting optional demographic information about our hackers. This information is anonymized and is used solely so we can gauge how we’re doing at our goal of making the hacking community more open and diverse.

###2. Analytics Information
PennApps uses Google Analytics to gather data about our sites’ users. This information is anonymized and used only to observe general patterns so that we can enhance our practices and user experience. For more information about Google Analytics, check out the [Google Analytics Terms of Use](http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html).

###3. Security Logging Information
PennApps logs limited personal information such as user account information, the user’s IP address, and the web browser user agent whenever certain actions such as logging in and resetting a password are performed. This information is only used to locate and prevent unauthorized access and is never shared with anybody outside of the PennApps organization.

###4. Reimbursement Information
If you qualify for travel reimbursements, you may be required to submit proof of your purchase as well as completed and signed tax forms and copies of identifying documents. This is required under the University of Pennsylvania’s disbursement policy and is never shared with anyone outside of the PennApps organization and the University of Pennsylvania business offices.

##What We Share and Who We Share it With
The privacy and safety of our applicants and participants are always our highest concern. As a result, we want you to be aware of what information we share with our partners and sponsors.

###Our Sponsors
The primary motivators for why sponsoring companies attend and support PennApps is to interact with our great participants. In return for their support, we provide certain sponsors with access to the following information about our hackers:
- Name
- Email
- Resume
- GitHub Username
- LinkedIn Profile
- School
- Major
- Graduating month and year
- Any awards you may have won at the current PennApps

You have the opportunity to decline providing any information to sponsors when you RSVP. Specifically, we never directly share your phone number or any demographic information.

###Major League Hacking
Since its inception, we’ve been working with Major League Hacking (MLH) to unify and contribute to the hackathon community. As part of this partnership, we share the following information with MLH which they treat in accordance with the [MLH Privacy Policy](https://mlh.io/privacy):

1. Name, email addresses, school, major, and graduation year for identification purposes. MLH will send you an opt-in email to ask if you want to be on their marketing list.

2. ChallengePost submission, and any prizes won - This information is used for MLH’s scoring and ranking system.

3. Name and school - This is provided to MLH in advance so they can cross-reference our list of hackers with their list of suspended and banned persons, as per [MLH’s Disciplinary Action Policy](http://static.mlh.io/docs/disciplinary-action-policy.pdf).

If you would like to opt out of providing your contact/identifying information and scoring information (#1 and #2) to MLH, please fill out [this form](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PSCKV9B) at least 7 days prior to the start of PennApps.

###The University of Pennsylvania
As part of our close partnership with the University of Pennsylvania, we work directly with Penn Engineering to ensure our hackathon's success. To help them to do their job, we provide Penn Engineering staff with personal information, such as dietary restrictions and emergency contact information, on request. In addition, travel reimbursement information is handled by the University’s business offices and is always kept confidential.

###Legal Purposes
Finally, we may share personal information with law enforcement and a court of law upon specific request to and beyond the extent required by law and by The University of Pennsylvania's policies. Does this mean the NSA has a direct tap into our database? We would like to think not, but it's definitely not beyond the realm of possiblilty.
